## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library to build user interfaces (UI) — mainly single-page applications.

Instead of reloading the whole page again and again, React:

Updates only the part that changes

Makes apps fast, smooth, and interactive

## Core Concept of React
The main idea of React is **components**.

**Everything in React is a component**.

A component is like a **JavaScript function** that returns UI or a reusable piece of code

## SPA approach - Single Page Application

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads only one HTML page and updates the content dynamically without reloading the entire page.

## Why We use React?
React is used even though we have JavaScript because **JavaScript can build everything, but React makes building complex and dynamic user interfaces much easier and cleaner**. With plain JavaScript, developers must manually manage the DOM, handle UI updates, and organize growing code, which becomes difficult in large applications. React solves this by using a **component-based structure**, **automatic UI updates through state**, and a **Virtual DOM** for better performance, allowing developers to focus on application logic instead of low-level DOM manipulation. In short, **JavaScript is the language, and React is the tool that simplifies and optimizes UI development using JavaScript**.
