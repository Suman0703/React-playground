# React Hooks Practice – useEffect + useCallback 🔁

This task demonstrates how `useEffect` and `useCallback` work individually and together to control **when code runs** and **when functions are recreated** in a React component. These hooks are essential for writing predictable, optimized, and clean React applications.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Task

The goal of this task is to deeply understand:
- Why `useEffect` exists
- Why `useCallback` exists
- How React re-renders components
- How dependency arrays work
- How to avoid unnecessary re-renders and side effects
- How both hooks can be combined correctly

This task focuses on **concept clarity**, not shortcuts.

## 🧠 Hooks Used

### 1️⃣ `useState`

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
